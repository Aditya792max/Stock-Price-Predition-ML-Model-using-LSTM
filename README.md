# Stock-Price-Predition-ML-Model-using-LSTM
The notebook demonstrates how to build and train an LSTM model for time-series forecasting, specifically to predict stock prices. It involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation phases.

Key Sections:

	1.	Importing Libraries:
	•	Essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn are imported for data manipulation and visualization.
	•	TensorFlow/Keras is used for building and training the LSTM model.
	2.	Data Loading and Exploration:
	•	The dataset, typically containing historical stock prices, is loaded using Pandas.
	•	Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed, including inspecting the structure, summary statistics, and visualizing the closing price trends over time.
	3.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handling missing values and data normalization (scaling) are performed to prepare the data for the LSTM model.
	•	The data is split into training and testing sets.
	•	Feature engineering is done by creating sequences (timesteps) as required for LSTM inputs.
	4.	Building the LSTM Model:
	•	An LSTM model is constructed using the Keras Sequential API.
	•	The architecture includes LSTM layers with specified units, followed by dense layers.
	•	Activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions are defined to compile the model.
	5.	Model Training:
	•	The model is trained using the training dataset.
	•	Training parameters such as epochs and batch size are specified.
	•	Training progress is monitored using metrics like loss and accuracy.
	6.	Model Evaluation and Prediction:
	•	The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance.
	•	Predictions are made, and the results are visualized against actual stock prices to demonstrate the model’s accuracy.
	7.	Visualization and Analysis:
	•	Several plots are generated to visualize the model’s predictions and compare them with the actual stock prices.
	•	The notebook may also include error analysis to highlight prediction accuracy and areas for improvement.
	8.	Conclusion:
	•	A summary of the model’s performance and potential next steps or improvements is provided.
